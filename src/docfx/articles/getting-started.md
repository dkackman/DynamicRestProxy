# DynamicRest - Getting Started

This article describes the basic conventions of the DynamicRest api.
See [advanced topics](advanced.md) for mechanisms to bypass these conventions.

## Conventions
1. There are five Http verbs: `get`, `put`, `post`, `patch` and `delete`, which are invoked as a normal method call
1. Http verb invocations are always `async` and return a `Task<T>`, where `T` is a dynamic object
1. Named arguments passed to a verb invocation are Uri parameters
1. Unnamed arguments passed to a verb invocation are request content 
1. Data Transfer Objects are serialized as JSON in both requests and responses
1. Http status codes that do not indicate success throw a `DynamicRestClientException`

## Basic Usage

Using the dynamic rest client starts with instantiating an instance, accessing an endpoint path, invoking a REST verb, and `await`ing the result. Always declare the `DynamicRestClient` as
a `dynamic`.

    dynamic client = new DynamicRestClient("http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/");
    dynamic result = await proxy.Locations.get(postalCode: "55116", countryRegion: "US", key: "api-key");
[Figure 1]

    GET http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations?postalCode=55116&countryRegion=US&key=api-key HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json, text/json, text/x-json, text/javascript
    Host: dev.virtualearth.net
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: Keep-Alive

### Building the endpoint path

The endpoint path is represented by dot-separated members of the dynamic client instance. Each node in the path is another dynamic object
to which additional path elements can be chained. The resulting path is relative to the base address set in the constructor of the client object.

The full endpoint Uri of the example in Figure 1 is:

http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations/

    dynamic google = new DynamicRestClient("https://www.googleapis.com/");
    dynamic bucket = await google.storage.v1.b("uspto-pair").get();
[Figure 2]

The code in Figure 2 chains multiple elements together to build a longer path. It also uses an escape mechanism in order to specify a
path element that is not a valid idenifier in C#. The resulting Uri is:

https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/uspto-pair/

note: Uri path segments are `UrlEncoded` internally, so there is no need to escape them.

### Passing parameters

Parameters are passed to the verb's invocation using [C#'s named parameter syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#named-arguments).

Any type of object can be passed as a parameter and will be serialized via the value object's
[ToString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring?view=netframework-4.7)
method. Both parameter names and values are [Url encoded](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webutility.urlencode?view=netframework-4.7)

The GET request for the example in Figure 1 is:
http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Locations/?postalCode=55116&countryRegion=US&key=api-key

Named parameters passed to a POST invocation will be [form url encoded](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1) in the request body.

note: Both parameter names and values are `UrlEncoded` internally, so there is no need to escape them.

### Passing content

Request content is passed to the verb invocation as an unnamed argument. The first unnamed argument will be passed as the request
content body. Subsequent unnamed arguments, [with the exception of some special types](advanced.md), will be ignored.

- Strings and primitive types will be passed as [StringContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.stringcontent.-ctor?view=netframework-4.7)
- Byte arrays will be passed as [ByteArrayContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.bytearraycontent?view=netframework-4.7)
- Any type of [stream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev15.query?appId=Dev15IDEF1&l=EN-US&k=k(System.IO.Stream);k(DevLang-csharp)&rd=true) will be passed as [StreamContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.streamcontent.-ctor?view=netframework-4.7)
- A `IEnumerable<object>` will be sent as multi-part content, with each constituent object being serialized by the above rules
- All other types will be serialized to JSON

For example:

    dynamic google = new DynamicRestClient("https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/");
                
    dynamic calendar = new ExpandoObject();
    calendar.summary = "unit_testing";

    var result = await google.calendars.post(calendar);
[Figure 3]

The resulting request shows the serialized content:

    POST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: OAuth xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Accept: application/json, text/json, text/x-json, text/javascript
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Host: www.googleapis.com
    Expect: 100-continue
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Length: 26

    {"summary":"unit_testing"}

### Invoking the Http verb

`get`, `put`, `post`, `patch` and `delete` are the http verbs supported by this REST client. Invocation of the verb method
sends the appropriate http message to the endpoint, along with defaults, parameters and content. Verb methods are always
lower case and return a `Task` object, so must be `await`-ed. Unless using a strongly typed response
(see [Advanced Topics](advanced.md)), the return will be `Task<object>` where the result type is a dynamic object.

## Setting Defaults

Setting defaults to be included in every request is accomplished by passing a 
[DynamicRestClientDefaults](xref:DynamicRestProxy.PortableHttpClient.DynamicRestClientDefaults) to the client constructor.

### Api keys

Many REST apis require an api-key, often as a parameter included on all requests. Setting it as a default parameter
will ensure it is added to every request.

    var defaults = new DynamicRestClientDefaults();
    defaults.DefaultParameters.Add("format", "json");
    defaults.DefaultParameters.Add("api_key", "my-api-key");
    defaults.DefaultParameters.Add("nojsoncallback", "1");

    dynamic flickr = new DynamicRestClient("https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/");
    dynamic user = await flickr.get(method: "flickr.people.findByUsername", username: "dkackman");

### Authentication and authorization

For services that require authentication and authorization, the `DynamicRestClientDefaults` type can also be used to 
pass auth data.

    var defaults = new DynamicRestClientDefaults()
    {
        AuthScheme = "OAuth",
        AuthToken = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    };

    dynamic google = new DynamicRestClient("https://www.googleapis.com/", defaults);
    dynamic profile = await google.oauth2.v1.userinfo.get();

The auth data is added to every request.    

    GET https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: OAuth xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Accept: application/json, text/json, text/x-json, text/javascript
    Host: www.googleapis.com
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

## Http Errors

In the event that the response message's [IsSuccessStatusCode](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage) property
is `false`, the invocation method will throw a 
[DynamicRestClientResponseException](xref:DynamicRestProxy.PortableHttpClient.DynamicRestClientResponseException).
This exception includes the response message so that additional details of the falure can be inspected.
